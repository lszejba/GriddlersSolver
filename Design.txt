Griddlers Solver Design Document

1. Goal of project
Solving Griddler provided as input to application
1.1 Sub goal 1
Returning information that input has/hasn't deterministic solution
1.2 Sub goal 2
Providing list of steps leading to solution (so it can be processed by another application to show the whole process step-by-step)

2. Input format
TODO: provide list of processed formats

3. Classes
Board
- width
- height
- rowGroupsSizes (int[])
- columnGroupsSizes (int[])
- rowLogicalGroups (LogicalGroup[])
- columnLogicalGroups (LogicalGroup[])

Field
- rowNumber
- columnNumber
- state (EMPTY / FULL / UNKNOWN(default) ) - this might be later expanded with secondary colors

PhysicalRow
- type (ROW / COLUMN)
- number
- contents (Field[])

LogicalGroup
- size
- previous (LogicalGroup)
- next (LogicalGroup)

MessageQueue
- messages (Message[])
- AddMessage(Message) - check messages if one with given recipient is present, don't add this one if true
